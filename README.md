- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rick-Shiffman
I have had both hardware and software experience for 
40 years. My hardware experience includes
 vlsi design and a vector drawing computer graphics system.
As to software, I have programmed in about 20 computer languages.
My favorite programming environment is
Muddle developed at MIT-DM in late 1960s and 1970s. I used Muddle 
to write MIGS or Muddle Interactive 
Graphs System.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...PDP-10s, ITS, MUDDLE,
Computer Graphics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
Python is my latest programming environment I 
have learn and use. My cellphone even
has a native Python programming environment.
Also, I have done a lot of code  
in Perl. Note: my cellphone has a 6 core 
  Apple A14 Bionic CPU and an 4 core GPU. It is also
About 2000 times faster than a PDP-10 mainframe.
Plus it has many Gbite of RAM and Storage.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Muddle, ITS, and vector graphics
